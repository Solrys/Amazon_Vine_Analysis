# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Background

For this project I will be analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

For this project, I had access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. I chose "Video Games" and used PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Afte that I used PySpark once again to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. 

## Method

* PYSPARK
* JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
* GOOGLE COLLAB
* SQL
* AWS

## Overview of the Analysis:

* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
* How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
* What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
